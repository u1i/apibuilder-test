# nodehandler-json

## About

This module installs the JSON flow-node to be used within [Axway API Builder's](https://www.axway.com/en/datasheet/axway-api-builder)

### Stringify

| Param | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

If this is a number, it indicates the number of space characters to use as white space; this number is capped at 10. If this is a string, its maximum length is 10;  the string is used as white space. If this parameter is not provided, no white space is used. |
